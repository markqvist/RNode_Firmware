## Sideband
Sideband is an LXMF client for Android, Linux and macOS. It has built-in support for communicating over RNodes, and many other mediums, such as Packet Radio, WiFi, I2P, or anything else Reticulum supports.

Sideband also supports exchanging messages through encrypted QR-codes on paper, or through messages embedded directly in lxm:// links.
